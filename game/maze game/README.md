##   Maze Game

This was inspired of the maze game which was highly popular prank game for some time.

* There is different levels  1-5. Where in every level the difficulty increases,
* The time limit for the game is 60 seconds for each level.
* After level 2 a emney is present which follows the mouse and tries to catch it.

##   Project summary

*   During the project i learned how to create basic illustrations for the background, characters.
*   During the project i experienced some challenges with <b>Sensing - Color touches color</b>, function. For some reason the function can not be called for <b> Black color</b> or <b> Red Shades </b>, the work around would be when a specific color is touched, do something.
